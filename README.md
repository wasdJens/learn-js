# learn-js

This repo is a sample codebase written for internships at conclurer for pupils that were doing either their [BoGy](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berufs-_und_Studienorientierung_an_Gymnasien) or [BORS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berufsorientierung_in_der_Realschule) internships. The core idea was to implement some basic functions in javascript and visualise them with the help of VueJS. Since in a timespan of a single week it is kinda difficult to teach the basic of programming some fundamentels were skipped. 

Each pupil got an basic instruction to git and cloned the master branch to start working on the implementation - The exersices are all found under `./docs` and are available in german.
